              open the exam app preview and before check-in on exam day. These
              settings may include verbosity, punctuation, text processing, and
              other settings as needed. On exam day, once you start check-in you
              won't be able to adjust your settings as the digital testing
              application is locked down.
            </p>
            <p>
              Configuration steps should be taken each time you take a digital
              practice or use the app demo, and on exam day before you check in
              for each exam.
